# Pipeline-Differental-Expression-Genes-DGEs-

We developed a pipeline for Differental Expression Genes (DGEs) based on DESeq (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106). We developed a R script to do a automatic analysis based on DESeq R library. It need only a count file with no header for sample of your interest.
